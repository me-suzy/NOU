  link. Telecore Media International shall designate and design the appearance and syntax of
  the hypertext transfer links (also called &quot;banners&quot;) which will appear at your
  site. </small></small></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><small><small>1.2 Upon sign-up you will receive an a
  confirmation of your participation. This communication will provide you with the URL to
  which you will link from the banner(s) appearing at your site. You must use the URL
  provided to you in order to receive credit to your account. Any falsification of sales
  statistics shall be cause for denial of payment and immediate termination and may result

  <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><small><small>1.4 Your commission shall be earned on
  each unique, confirmed sale excluding the affiliate which occurs after a new member has
  paid for a Drewstar's Superscripts membership and funds have been transferred
  electronically from the new member to Telecore Media International.&nbsp; Time for
  electronic transfer of funds is usually 5 business days from date of sale.&nbsp; Telecore
  Media International may delay payment for sales which have not been confirmed until the
  next pay period.&nbsp; Telecore Media International may revoke any sale which fails to
  produce full electronic transfer of funds as payment for this membership.&nbsp; </small></small></font></p>
